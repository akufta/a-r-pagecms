## **Camera/ Audio Suggestions & Reviews**

* Your mobile phone probably has a great camera. It’s honestly a great place to start, as it forces you to walk around to get good angles, learn how to expose and compose.
  * You can even get some intense film making accessories for your mobile phone.
* For the best compact $ can buy, Sony RX100 Mark I-IV have great reviews. I currently have the Mark I and love it.
* [Equipment for low budget filmmaking](https://learnaboutfilm.com/making-a-film/equipment-for-low-budget-filmmaking/) - recommendations for basically all types of film making gear. Great site!
* [Cameras](https://amzn.to/2CFUf2n): Canon DSLRs, Sony, & Panasonic are especially great for filmmakers. I would look up reviews and choose based on the features you want.
* Audio is a must have. You can use ones that plug directly into the camera w/ a sound muffler, or external mics.
* Sound is important, good reviews on:
  * [Blue Snowball iCE Condenser Microphone, Cardioid - Black](https://amzn.to/2yZK8TS)
  * [Blue Yeti USB Microphone - Space Gray](https://amzn.to/2B0iUy4)
* After researching, I currently have [this](https://amzn.to/2AYxNAW) (Zoom H1). Not a direct plug in for my camera, but it's great since I can use it for other things.
* If you have a few thousand, go get a RED. Not well versed in the uber expensive, but if anyone wants a $$$$ camera guide curation, I can make that in the future.
