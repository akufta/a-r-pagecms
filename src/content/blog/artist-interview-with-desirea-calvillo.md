Introducing, Desirea Calvillo an abstract artist!



#### Hi, glad to have you! Please introduce yourself!

Hi! My name is Desirea Calvillo, and I'm the founder/artist of Fiercely Fem.

#### When did you start making art? What does art offer you?

I've been an artist for as long as I can remember, as early as elementary school. But I got serious about my art at the beginning of 2019. The tragic and unexpected death of my cousin Danny in January is what got me back into painting. It seemed the only way I knew how to deal with grief.

#### Which piece or series are you most proud of and why? 

My Classy & Sassy piece is the one I love the most. It makes me smile when I look at it. It's a piece that truly brings me joy, and wasn't created out of sadness.

#### Is there a story behind one of your works you would like to share? 

I've been into abstract art for as long as I can remember. In high school art classes, I'd often break away from the assigned task and do whatever I felt — which was always abstract. So I broke away from anything resembling realism and did an abstract using an acrylic pouring method. And then I did a dozen more, and Rendezvous of Color was born. It really was the beginning of finding my niche and style.

#### What would you say is your main source of inspiration?

When I had a daughter of my own, I realized how important it is to teach young girls today about female empowerment, and the opportunities that they can have with hard work, dedication, solid ethics, empathy, and simply being tenacious. Strong, smart women are breaking more and more glass ceilings every day. I design with these women in mind and the ones they inspire.

#### What are your favorite artist tools?

I really love just getting my hands in there and manipulating the paint that way, but if I had to claim a favorite tool, I'd have to say wooden skewer sticks have been my go-to. It's a strange choice, I know, but it gives me the control I like, without the confines of a brush.

#### What does your workflow look like?

It's definitely controlled by my mood. I can spend an hour just picking out colors before I even begin painting. Some pieces are very thought out and planned pours, while others are more chaotic. It just depends on how I feel at the moment.

#### What are some pieces of advice you have for other artists?

Not every piece you create has to be perfect. Just keep creating. The more you create, the more you'll learn about yourself and your technique. 
  

#### Do you have any favorite resources for learning art? 

Honestly, trial and error. I prefer to test out things on my own rather than study others. 

#### Do you have a certain project or work in progress to update us on?

I just finished a 24"x36" acrylic pour on stretched canvas. She doesn't have a name yet, but I'm looking to use it for a design for the Women's March 2020. So be sure to follow @fiercelyfem and visit https://FiercelyFem.com to find out more.
