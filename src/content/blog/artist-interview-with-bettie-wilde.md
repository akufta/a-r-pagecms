### What would you say is your main source of inspiration?

A friend reached out to me during quarantine, she was being abused for the last 30 years by an ex of mine. When I got the call I froze in panic knowing what she was experiencing. I felt responsible for not reporting my ex when I was younger. Going through that with her really opened my eyes.

I decided to write a book helping to support women going through domestic violence called [*All The Pretty Flowers*](https://www.bettiewilde.com/product-page/AllThePrettyFlowersBook). It was a great victory, I was so proud and grateful that I could help her out of this situation and provide a way for women to build their strength. My paintings from my collection [*All The Pretty Flowers*](https://www.bettiewilde.com/all-the-pretty-flowers) series are a homage to women who are suffering in quarantine with their abuser. 

Emotions, I can't get away from them unless I throw them into a painting. Then I can let them go and show them respect. Pain is part of growing.

### When did you start making art? What does art offer you?

I started painting as a child. My mother loved when I painted and it was the one thing that her and I connected on. I started painting feverishly, upset I didn’t do it when she was alive. Quarantine really gave me the time and place to really hash out what I was feeling. For me art is my voice. I can’t tell you in the same depth all that I feel without using a visual medium. You can’t lie in your art, the truth bleeds through.

### Is there a story behind one of your works you would like to share?

The day my book launched I received the news that my mother passed away. I was struck down with enormous grief. I did the only thing I knew to do was to paint and my series [*Obsolete*](https://www.bettiewilde.com/obsolete-paintings) was born. I wasn’t able to see my mother and never got to say good-bye. She died alone in quarantine.

### What are some pieces of advice you have for other artists?

Stop trying to be perfect. Get messy, get as ugly as you can be and then step back.

### Do you have any favorite resources for learning art?

Paint every day! I am inspired by other artists, now you can find so many wonderful classes online and not have to spend thousands on a college to learn and master your skill. Eventually, you will find your voice. Be persistent.

The Wandering Muse was a course I took of Jeanne Oliver and it taught me to be myself. It was the first time I saw myself in my work.
