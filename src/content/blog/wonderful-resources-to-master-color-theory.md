Learning Color Theory is essential for aesthetically appealing art that contains color. It connects to other concepts in art theory like value/lighting as well, so it is important.

This image breaks down basic color schemes & color theory. Referencing this and/or committing this to memory will help you design color palettes and make decisions that look aesthetically pleasing.

First of all, a brief note on the some of the applications of color theory:

## **Color Theory Application – How to Apply Color Theory to Your Art**

* Want more realistic drawings? Shade and highlight subjects with complimentary colors for richer and more accurate subjects. I.e, drawing a banana? get your purple out and shade with that. Make sure you don’t make the purple oversaturated though, otherwise it will look off. Blending/glazing with complimentary colors looks realistic, actually.
* Don’t go overboard with colors. One or two accents look good. There are many colors schemes to choose from, but don’t try to use all of them at once.
* I would recommend generating a ton of quick thumbnails with color schemes you think would work. You know what mood you want, so experiment, experiment, experiment
* Try to be aware of how nearby colored objects affect the color of other nearby colored objects. Texture/opacity of the object also plays into this. This is important bc light gets tinted as it bounces off surfaces. i.e., place a white ball near a red towel, and you will see some red on the white ball.
* You can break the rules if you want, don’t feel like your drawing has to fit color theory 100% of the time. We’re artists, we break rules once we know them!
