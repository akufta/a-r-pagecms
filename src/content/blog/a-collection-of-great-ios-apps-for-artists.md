description: My favorite iOS apps for artists! This collection includes art reference apps, photo editor apps, writing apps, and painting and design apps!
---

I plan to write detailed reviews for these iOS artist apps (as I try a ton of different apps), but here is a list of my current favorites. Most apps I have tried, though there are a few that I will buy soon due to great reviews. I encourage you to come back every so often because I plan to update this list!



Currently, I have an iPhone & some creative apps are iOS only. I used to have an Android, so I tried to find a few good alternatives for my android homies out there. However, on the productivity side, Android users have awesome options!

Have a favorite? Drop by the comments & add your favorite iOS artist apps!

## Art Reference Apps

[**Handy Art Reference Tool**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/handy-art-reference-tool/id478643661?mt=8) \[iOS only \]- "rotatable 3D lit hand with a variety of poses useful for drawing", highly reviewed.

​	[Android Alternative](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.JindoBlu.HandDraw3D&hl=en) - seems similar.

He has wonderful resources in general, visit him [here](www.proko.com/).

[**Art Pose**](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/artpose/id836464625?mt=8) \[iOS only\] - another poseable model. (Have not tried this one yet)

### Medical Anatomy Reference

Lovely functionality for free

[**3D4Medical's Apps**](https://3d4medical.com) -primarily linking to iOS versions, they have a few old versions for Android though.

## Photography Apps

[**Enlight**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/enlight/id930026670?mt=8) - iOS only ([Photofox (Enlight 2)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/enlight-photofox-enlight-2/id1191337894?mt=8)) - I prefer the one time $4 app, Enlight, but the second version is nice because sometimes subscriptions are a more sustainable business model for the devs. I love this app bc of the aesthetic interface and the wealth of features in provides.

**Snapseed** - [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619?mt=8) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&hl=en) - made by Nik & acquired by Google, Snapseed is a fast, well designed photo editor. It's free and comes with a lot of useful features. It's not over cluttered either.

**Polarr** - [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/polarr-photo-editor-photo-editing-tools-for-all/id988173374?mt=8) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=photo.editor.polarr) / Desktop / Web - I really like this one's interface because it has sliders that make fine adjustments easy on mobile. Also has a lot of unique features and a lovely design. Tried it when it was in beta & it's grown a lot!

[Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/ipad/) - iPad only - also comes in a desktop [mac](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/affinity-photo/id824183456?mt=12) & [windows](https://affinity.store/buy/windows/photo/) app. A well designed app, a bit of a learning curve (desktop version) but has so many features & is comparable to PS @ a much cheaper price.

**Adobe Lightroom** - [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-photoshop-lightroom-for-iphone/id878783582?mt=8) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.lrmobile&hl=en) - awesome for developing RAW photos, classy desktop app as well. Has great management features and edits nondestructively. The ability to export multiple times w different settings is a great feature.

[**Adobe's Mobile Apps**](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/catalog/mobile.html) **-** available for iOS & Android -in addition to lightroom, Adobe has a lot of great apps. I have most of them and use them regularly. (Especially the Capture one)

[**Pixelmator**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id924695435?mt=8) **-** iOS only & also has a [mac version](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id407963104?mt=12) - a faster, cheaper alternative to photoshop. Has a lot of features, but not too bloated. I like the design as well.

**April** - [ iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/april-layouts-photo-collage-and-poster-maker/id1121943475?mt=8) / [android ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.pinguo.april_collage&hl=en)- my favorite free collage app that doesn't have annoying watermarks. Easy to use interface, lots of options, great templates. Highly recommend this one.

[**ProCam 4**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/procam-4-manual-camera-raw/id730712409?mt=8) - iOS only - a wonderful manual camera + RAW app. I love advanced features and well designed interface. Highly recommended for people who want more than basic controls. Android Alternative-  [Open Camera](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sourceforge.opencamera&hl=en) / [Camera MX](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx) or read this lovely [article](https://www.androidauthority.com/best-camera-apps-for-android-188148/) by Android Authority.

**Afterlight** - [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/afterlight/id573116090?mt=8) / [Android ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fueled.afterlight)- great filter options & has an easy interface for quick edits.

**VSCO** - [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/vsco-cam/id588013838?ls=1&mt=8) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vsco.cam&referrer=utm_source%3Dcorporate%26utm_medium%3Dcorpweb) quite popular, especially for its filters & community.

**Pixlr** - so useful for quick edits & also more detailed ones. The web version comes in handy for quick fixes, but their are also desktop and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixlr-express-plus/id526783584?mt=8) & [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixlr.express) apps.

## Painting & Design Apps

[**Procreate**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/procreate-sketch-paint-create/id425073498?mt=8) - iOS only - highly reviewed. I have the Pocket version, which is a bit cheaper. Great brush options, clean and uncluttered interface, and a lot of functions for digital painters.

**Pixite Apps** - both design & photography apps- Fragment, Pigment, & Shift are available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Pixite&hl=en), while on iOS, their more complete catalog is available.

* I have & adore [assembly](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/assembly-graphic-design-for/id1024210402?ls=1&mt=8&pt=14691&ct=assembly_website&at=11l4HQ), which is a super nice app for designing vectors on your mobile device; [union](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/union/id849145835?mt=8&uo=4&at=11l4HQ) , where you can combine & blend images easily, & [fragment](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fragment/id767104707?pt=14691&ct=fragment_website&at=11l4HQ&mt=8), where you can transform photos into neat designs.

**ArtRage** - [iOS](https://www.artrage.com/artrage-ipad/) iPad / [Android](https://www.artrage.com/artrage-android/) / Desktop - ArtRage has a really cool brush engine that mimics traditional media.

**Adobe Illustrator Draw** - [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-illustrator-draw/id911156590?mt=8) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.creativeapps.draw&hl=en) - allows you to sketch in vectors, which is a great format when you want to resize your art later nondestructively.

**Autodesk** offers several [apps](https://www.autodesk.com/mobile-apps) on both iOS & Android. I like their sketchbook app.

## Writing Apps

There are a lot of writing apps for mac and windows, but a few less that are cross platform. Here are the best mobile writing apps for iPhone and iPad I could find. 

**[Scrivener](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scrivener/id972387337?mt=8&at=1001ly2n)**- this is an excellent app! I love the interface and how you can customize it to fit *your* workflow. They also have a [Mac version of their writing app](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/scrivener-3/id1310686187?mt=12&at=1001ly2n).

- One time purchase 

[Ulysses](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225571038?mt=8&at=1001ly2n) - an excellent writing environment for Mac, iPhone, and iPad. It's got a clean interface and flexible options with export and management of files. A bit less complex than Scrivener, but well regarded in the writing community. 

- Requires a subscription

[Bear](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447?mt=8&at=1001ly2n)- a very pretty markdown editor with linkable notes. It's got a nice live preview, so you can see what you're doing. It's also really pretty. Sync does require a subscription, but it works fine without that.
