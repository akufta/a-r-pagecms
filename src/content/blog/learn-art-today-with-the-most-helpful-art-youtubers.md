## [Proko](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClM2LuQ1q5WEc23462tQzBg)

One of my personal favorites! His anatomy tutorials are stellar.

> "When you watch Proko tutorials you’ll notice that I try to make them entertaining while keeping them educational. I feel that if you’re having fun and enjoying the learning process, you learn better. You retain more information, you pay more attention, you’re much more likely to continue learning and more likely to go back and re-watch tutorials. And it will leave you more inspired and motivated to go practice."

## Youtube as an alternative to art school

> Hey there!  So..I have always been very interested in art but never thought I’d pursue the art path so I know nothing about drawing and am a total beginner. Please do you have any idea where I should start? Like any schools that accepts total beginners cause I’m currently doing my O’levels and won’t have much time to practise myself for now though I know that’s what I should be doing.

Hi there!

I compiled all my best tips on how to start drawing as beginner in these two articles, targeted by medium. I hope you like them and that they help you:

* [**Beginner’s guide to digital art** ](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fartres.xyz%2Fpost%2Fbeginners-guide-to-digital-art%2F&t=MDMzOTEwMTVjZTQxZWYyOGM4OTNkZjQ3ZjBkMDNlZDUyOTZlYjliMixVcVZRMlNDWA%3D%3D&b=t%3Ac4za80VKBG4D5SwKeVtkjQ&p=https%3A%2F%2Fart-res.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F169495673017%2Fhey-there-soi-have-always-been-very-interested&m=0)

There’s online, high quality video courses  that are completely free. You can also try  [skillshare](https://skillshare.eqcm.net/c/1880335/476276/4650), if you use that link, you can try 2 months for free!

I do not really think art school is necessary to learn the fundamentals. It’s pretty expensive and many of my favorite artists have taught themselves, or perhaps have gone to a few workshops instead (much cheaper).

* Here’s a few articles on the subject:
* [Don’t go to art school – I. M. H. O. – Medium](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fi-m-h-o%2Fdont-go-to-art-school-138c5efd45e9&t=ODBiNzNlMGJjOGEzMGY3YmY2NzJjMDZjYWEwOGI2ODEzYzE0Njg0OSxVcVZRMlNDWA%3D%3D&b=t%3Ac4za80VKBG4D5SwKeVtkjQ&p=https%3A%2F%2Fart-res.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F169495673017%2Fhey-there-soi-have-always-been-very-interested&m=0)

If you have the money, go for it! I just recommend reading into the subject first, though!

Art school is good for connections, but art marketing online is possible, thanks to social media and the internet.

Thanks for reading! I hope this helped!
