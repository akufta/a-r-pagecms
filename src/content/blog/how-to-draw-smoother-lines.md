Drawing smoother lines is a real challenge, for many of us! Here are a few quick tips for drawing smoother lines.



## Hand position

* For smoother lines, try not to draw from your fingers and try to draw from your elbow or shoulder. This might require a change of grip.

* Try ghosting the stroke in the air before you commit. 
* When practicing ovals, circles, and lines, go _fast._  You also want to do linear relatively fast. 
* If you’re doing it traditional, try using a lightbox so you don’t damage the sketch when doing line art. This way you can practice lining faster and smoother with a lot less stress. 

## Digital Options

* Digitally, all you need is another layer. A lot of digital art programs also come with a brush stabilizer as well, which can be super useful. Krita and  Photoshop have it built in. 

    * You can also install a program like [Lazy Nezumi](https://lazynezumi.com) for Windows or [Hej Stylus](https://hejstylus.com) for Mac. These are both paid, polished  options by Indie Devs.
