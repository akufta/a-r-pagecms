A few words on consistency, from an artist and medical student. 



First off, let me tell you, consistency is the unsung hero of progress, especially in fields that require a lot of skill and patience, like art and medicine. I am pretty critical to myself when regarding my progress in anything, art included.

As a med student, I am busy but still want to make time for practicing art. For me, art is not  just a hobby,it's a form of expression, a way to unwind, and a skill I want to hone. And just like medicine, it requires consistent practice. 

Now, art can be extremely frustrating especially when you are trying to draw something. You're trying to capture a vision, and sometimes your hands just can't keep up with your imagination. But here's where consistency comes in. It's all about taking it one step at a time and reflecting as you go. Practice how you play, but don't forget to review the footage! 

I am sure a lot of my readers are also busy, and it can be hard to practice while fulfilling my obligations. Time management is key to this–I set aside specific times for my Anki flashcards (morning) and my art practice (night). It's not about how long you practice; it's about how consistently you do it. Even if it's just 15 minutes of sketching or a quick run-through of flashcards while waiting for the bus, it counts. These little pockets of time add up, and before you know it, you're not just making progress, you're seeing real, tangible results.

Lastly, let's talk about the payoff. For me, the medical field is not just about grades; it's about the patients I'll be treating in the future. Every flashcard I flip brings me one step closer to being a better doctor. Similarly, every sketch I complete adds to my skill set as an artist. I think a lot of us forget how things intertwine in life, and I'm sure you can see how your work can benefit your art and vice versa. 

Consistency might not be glamorous, but I think it helps me combat feelings of being overwhelmed I am not improving enough.
