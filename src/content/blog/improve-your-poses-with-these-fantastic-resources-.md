## Importance of learning figure drawing

Learning to how to draw emotional, dynamic poses is important for creating an image that holds the viewer's attention. A solid anatomical foundation can help you with this task. If you have been wondering: what are some good resources to learn human figure drawing? I got you homie! Here are a few of the best anatomy tutorials focused on movement and poses that I could find, along with a guide for starting out.



### A small guide on effective practice for figure drawing

I recommend sketching out a lot of quick poses every day to practice. This way, when you can't think of something to draw, you can use one of your ideas instead of a stiff and boring pose.  Gesture drawings require you to strip details and go for energy. Start w/ a line or s curve for the spine and find something dynamic to draw. Try to go pretty quickly, letting the meticulous details go and just you and your pencil/pen on the paper.

### Stuck? Learn anatomy

First of all, I first recommend learning anatomy and range of motion so you can generate your own organic poses on the fly, but having inspiration certainly helps!

My best resource for learning artistic human anatomy would be the [ebook](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/l/anatomybook) I wrote on the topic. I also have created an [anatomy framework & set of tutorials](https://artres.xyz/post/a-round-up-of-anatomy-quick-tips/)to help you learn proportions.
