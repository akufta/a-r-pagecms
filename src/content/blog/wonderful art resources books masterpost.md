description: Looking for great art tutorial books? Here is a curated list of the best art books on anatomy, traditional art, art theory, and more.
---
Heyo, here are a few [physical art book](https://amzn.to/2wE3ZYG) recommendations! I handpicked these books and genuinely recommend them.

To be transparent, I am linking amazon affiliate links to these books, which you can get print/ebook edition. Funds will help me continue to run this site and also pay for college!



The library is a fantastic place for books, though for art books, I like to buy them eventually so I can reference them whenever, forever.

Will be updating this post regularly!

## Anatomy

Books that I feel contend for the spot of  best anatomy book for artists.

* [**Classic Human Anatomy: The Artist’s Guide to Form, Function, and Movement**](https://amzn.to/2uNzKQ1)is awesome! It is so detailed and gives you insertions, origins, etymology of the parts to help you remember them (word roots and also latin names!!), and multiple views. I think Valerie Winslow did an incredible job on organizing the book and drawing out clear and detailed diagrams,  and  it is definitely worth picking up.

* [**The Anatomy Coloring Book 4th Edition**](https://amzn.to/2hgLGFt) - actually teaches you medical anatomy, which is really cool. Artists will find the musculoskeletal system section most useful, though the whole book is interesting. I personally recommend photocopying the pages so you can use them again! I am really interested in medicine, and this is one of my favorite books. Kapit and Elson did a great job!
* Andrew Loomis has [several awesome](https://amzn.to/2vYC9WO) books, and I personally like [**Figure Drawing for All It’s Worth**](https://amzn.to/2wf5Zp7). This book is in the public domain(as are the others), so if you want a PDF version of it, [here is where you can find it! ](https://archive.org/details/loomis_FIGURE_draw)A physical copy can be nice though!

## Colored Pencil

* [**The Ultimate Guide To Colored Pencil: Over 40 step-by-step demonstrations for both traditional and watercolor pencils**](https://amzn.to/2hUn2e1) by Gary Greene
  * An absolutely fantastic pick. I love his realistic style, clear text, and explanations. There is a mix of useful demonstrations and concepts.
* [**Colored Pencil Painting Bible: Techniques for Achieving Luminous Color and Ultrarealistic Effects**](https://amzn.to/2vOXWD5) by [Alyona Nickelsen](https://www.amazon.com/Alyona-Nickelsen/e/B001JS9KN0/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1)
  * She writes about pretty unique and lovely tips here.

## Pastel

* [**Painting Animals that Touch the Heart**](https://amzn.to/2wSet6b) by [Lesley Harrison](https://www.amazon.com/Lesley-Harrison/e/B001K86WJY/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1)
  * She is so talented! Her style is gorgeous and realistic, and her walkthroughs are thorough and explain topics well.

## Marker

* [**Shojo Wonder Manga Art School: Create Your Own Cool Characters and Costumes with Markers**](https://amzn.to/2wSqjgv) by [Supittha Bunyapen](https://www.amazon.com/Supittha-Bunyapen/e/B007DMVIJA/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1)
  * I now mostly aim for a more realistic style, but the tips in this book for coloring are applicable to all types of styles. Her advice is cleanly laid out, and the demos are absolutely gorgeous.

I hope you check out some of these books, they have been helpful resources for me!
