## Introducing Cindy Qu

Cindy Qu aka Lovenemy is an artist who travels frequently between the U.S. and Asia. Besides art, she is also a philosopher and writer who enjoys exploring and capturing the beauty and wonder of life. The ordinary people from all walks of life and every corner in the world are her muses and heroes.

**Please introduce yourself and tell us what you do.**

> Thank you for having me here. I’m excited to share my story. My name is Cindy Qu, aka Lovenemy. I am a visual artist specializing in photography. What’s interesting is that I don’t do art for full-time job. I used to work as a director at a multinational consumer electronics company and am heading to law school for my JD degree this year. I’m particularly enthusiastic about taking pictures with a $300 smartphone and a tripod. Well, many times, I am also my own model for portrait shoot.

**As a self-taught artist, how do you see yourself compared with those professionally trained artists?**

> I love this question! First, I totally respect the creativity and hard works my professionally trained counterparts take in advancing their art careers. Many of them are truly brilliant for sure. What I could offer, fundamentally speaking, I think is a unique angle to view the world and a spontaneous way to do art. You know I’ve always believed that, the love of life should be on top of any skill for an artist. It stays true to all of us.

**What advice do you have for other artists? Professional, amateur and freelancer, all included.**

> The most important advice I really hope to give to my peers in the art world is that don’t be afraid to be inspired. Be inspired by landscapes that look totally exotic to you, be inspired by people you’ve never expected to know, and even be inspired by the pain and hurt in life. We should embrace spontaneity and I think these incredible or sometimes heartbreaking encounters in our life are our best sources of creativity.

**Anything else you would like to add?**

> Yeah, one thing I’d like to add: as an artist, I really look forward to reading more stories of my peers from the world. I know how hard it is for someone new to break into this highly competitive industry, but because of platforms like yours, we can make our works seen and voice heard. Yay! Thank you!

I am so happy I can help improve your visibility!
