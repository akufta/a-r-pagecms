###  Interview

####  Hi! Thanks so much for taking the time to complete this interview. You rock! Please introduce yourself!

>  I'm a Vietnamese artist, I love art, game, philosophy, Buddhism, Zen, and I'm Christian too :))

#### When did you start making art? What does art offer you?

>  I have drawn for a long time, but I really began at December 2012. :D

#### Which piece or series are you most proud of and why? Is there a story behind it?

>  I uploaded a piece, named Painful to death, but I broke the 3rd rule of Reddit, and I will reupload it the next time :D I like it because the meaning of it, and this piece has me win a small contest too LOL

*Removed by Reddit, but too amazing not to find. Here*

#### What would you say is your main source of inspiration?

>  Actually, I'm inspired by many many things in life. But what I want to aim for is to make something meaningful, something that gives a message or a feeling... And I'm doing one now, and I think this will be a big step in my work now. Wait for it ! :D

Danh's going to upload his favorite works soon, be sure to follow him on his social media!

#### What are your favorite artist tools? What does your workflow look like?

> I like [Paintstorm](https://paintstormstudio.com/), but it still not complete and stable as Photoshop, so I still use [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/Photoshop) most of the time. I used to start in BW before coloring for a long time. Now, I go to color directly. I now like to start from a sketch line art, and then going to render. But depending on the work, I can change my workflow, which is very good. :D

####  What are some pieces of advice you can give your fellow artists?

>  Advice– my only advice is just working hard. Everything will come when you are working hard; maybe not today, not tomorrow, but one day. Or you just are not trying enough. Not talent, not skill, not tools, not inspiration... the diligence is the most important thing you need. So, just draw ! :D
