# Why composition matters

This post is relevant for all kinds of art because an interesting composition is key for most pieces of visual art. Having a strong composition will help you catch your viewer eye. Composition will allow you to structure your piece in a way that can guide the eye around the image, which is a pretty powerful tool.

There are several kinds of composition styles that are pretty aesthetically appealing.

### A few general tips

* Try to make your composition guide the viewer’s eye in a certain direction, say towards a focal point, then around the piece. You can achieve this with motion or contrast in value, or color, or shapes.
* Try not to make the composition too chaotic, and work to balance different aspects of your piece.
* Thumbnails are very helpful for generating composition ideas. It's better to find a solid composition first, before working out all the details.
* Keep experimenting with different types of composition/shapes that lead the eye to different parts of your image. 
* Watch out for negative space, aesthtically pleasing framing, where you zoom/crop. 


### Different Types of Composition

If you're having trouble, here a few specific types of composition you can use as guidelines for your pieces. Best practices, if you will. Of course, there are no hard rules in art!

#### Symmetrical
  * Basically interesting things are happening on both "sides" of a plane. This one works well when you try to convey motion or some kind of geometric shape, ie, buildings/mountains. 
  * You can also implement symmetry on both axes and go for a radially symmetric piece. Think of pizza slices, or a sea star. 

#### Rule of Thirds
  * Basically, you first divided your viewing frame into thirds, both horizontally and vertically. Next, you select an intersection of those points as your focal point.

#### Shape Based
Try working with different shapes:
*  Slanted lines as a rhythm for composition can look pleasing (diagonals). 
* Triangles, rectangles, circles, and others can lead the eye around your piece well.

#### Golden Ratio – mathematical basis
