**When did you start making art?**

> I’m an impulse painter. I started painting few years ago just because I can’t do otherwise. I’m bounded with music, the rhythms you can’t control.

** Which piece or series are you most proud of and why? Is there a story behind it?**

> My LP and Skateboart series, especially - I’m working on a new serie called 16:9, inspired by movies that inspired me

**What would you say is your main source of inspiration?**

> Music, of course. From different sources: Spotify, old scratchy, dusty vinyls, OST, street musicians and the music I produce. So, basically, I paint something you can hear and also watch, observe, feel

**What does your workflow look like?**

> I just sit in my studio for hours listening my favorite music albums in order to determine the colors I will use. Then I take action, performing the sounds, the notes, the vibrations on canvas - or other surfaces such as skateboards, aluminum and wooden panels

**What are some pieces of advice you have for other artists?**

> Be curious, be bold, get dirty, very dirty. Be always kind and positive, never give up and do not be afraid of judgments. Try, try, and try: xperiment with colors, surfaces, forms, mediums, tools. Get inspirations from everyone and everything, everywhere, without prejudice.
