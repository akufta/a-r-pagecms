Social media is an important part of artistic marketing. Though you should not measure your worth in social media followers, it's very helpful to have a social networking presence in order to promote your work!

> "Post as often as you can, even if you don’t think it’s very good consistency helps a lot to get yourself noticed. Also don’t be afraid to comment on other people’s work! I find I’m more likely to look at websites of people who comment and leave their thoughts than those who just leave a like."

> "I think the most important thing, if you're trying to build a following, is to post frequently and consistently. Overall, the times when I've gained the most followers have been the times when I've posted new content at least once every 48 hours. Putting your work out there on a regular basis is the best thing you can do for your visibility, in addition to tricks like proper tagging and posting at high-traffic times."

> "Talking to other people from the community, not being pushy, but starting a conversation is nice, espwcially if there is fandom involved. Complimenting others work, i actually met a really good friend like that. Going through the new posts or a certain tag, not just the popular but fresh."

"Firstly, get DeviantArt! Use it as a “home base” of sorts. Dump all your stuff there so you have a portfolio of all your work. It’s also a really great place to provide commission samples, if you’re thinking of doing that.   Secondly, and I think this is most important for me: start on one platform first and branch out once you get the hang of that main one. I know this is completely contrary to what some people swear by, but I personally found it really overwhelming to manage more than one social media account at a time, and catering to each one’s unique tastes. Which brings me to my final tip:  Post the right stuff in the right places! Different social media sites are good for posting different things, such as Tumblr and Twitter for fanart, for example. Don’t let a site’s niche dictate what you create, but do consider that when choosing a platform to start on. Good luck!"

> "Post at the right time (around 4pm for tumblr), use your tags, be kind to others and make content you would like to see. and don't feel bad about re blogging your work. Above all else, look for feedback and keep posting, no one is going to stay on your blog if you only have one or two pieces they like, so don't get discouraged if you don't get immediate attention."
