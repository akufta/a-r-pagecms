* I analyzed the proportions of the human body, and created a general diagram for the front and side views.  I really think this one is most important ones to look at.

Notes & Measurements

* Approximately : bottom of eye to the bottom of the chin = chin to collar bone
* Do not flatten the back of the head, unless your character has a dent in their head.
* It’s easier to draw these angles if you draw a cross that guides the eye line and then the flat vertical ( | )line of the face.
