#### It’s a pleasure having your attention to talk with us. Can you briefly describe your background, where you’re from, how you got started in the industry?

> Hey! Thank you for the opportunity on this quick talk. My name is Nicholas King but some know me by ‘Nickels’ on the internet. I’m American, from Florida specifically but I travel the world depending on the work. I’m usually based in Dubai for the most part since my team of super experienced artists are there, but I jump around for remote supervision when needed. I went to school for Computer Programming in Penn State, but after 2 years realized that I needed to do something more creative, so I enrolled in an art school in Tampa, Florida. After receiving my Bachelor’s in Fine Arts, I got started in the professional industry as an intern. Moved up to Junior Motion Graphics Artist, then 2D/3D Artist, then Senior CG Artist, CG Supervisor, and finally Head of CG.

#### Your work looks extremely realistic, can you tell us how you’ve achieved the sense of realism?

>Honestly, each project is different. True, I always use the fundamentals, but the path and angle that I go by is always different. I couldn’t tell you a sure-fire way of how I achieve it, and it doesn’t matter what tool you use, just as long as it looks right!

#### On average, how long does it take to finish one of your videos?

>I would say 2 weeks. Around a week to create the concept / model and around a week to execute it. This is all after I’ve met with my collaborator, decide on an idea, and shoot the video.

#### Did you always know you wanted to be an artist or did you discover this later on in life?

>I’ve always had an itch for creativity. Whether it was drawing, making books, creating film or stop motion with my first camera. Whatever it was, I just wanted to create. I got crazy in to video games (as any kid usually would) and I thought that’s it, I wanted to create games. I started programming at a young age and enrolled at Penn State for Computer Programming. On the side I would make websites and supplemented the graphics with things I would create in 3D. I realized after two years that I wanted to do 3D fulltime, so I transferred to an art school in Florida and the rest is history.

#### How do you market your services to acquire commissioned projects?

> Actually, my whole instagram page is a big exposure hub for me and my collaborators. Most of my work comes from those videos since they tend to go semi-viral. With that said, any of the commissioned projects (music videos, visualizers, and commercials) will be brought to my CG team so I guess in a way I am also a producer, or client manager?

#### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

> I love this industry, so I know I will be doing this. A lot has changed in the past 5 years so I really don’t know. I just know that I need to constantly be moving towards bigger and better things. Never stop growing!
