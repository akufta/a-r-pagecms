An interview with the artist, Totemworlds. 



#### Hi, glad to have you! Please introduce yourself!

I’m Totemworlds, a multidisciplinary artist who loves making music and visual art and combining them to create awesome looking and sounding videos!



Here's [my most recent video](https://youtu.be/CPBLQsoblQw), Chapter 7 of 12 total in my visual album “Stuga Bloodstoner.”

#### When did you start making art? What does art offer you?

I have always been artistically inclined, since I was a little boy! It was a form of therapy for me, though I didn’t know it at the time. I created a world in my imagination where I could escape from the hardship and boredom I experienced in those years.

#### Which piece or series are you most proud of and why? Is there a story behind it?

That would have to be my debut album Stuga Bloodstoner, it’s a visual album I’ve been working for a couple of years now, it’s my most ambitious work. After graduating college, I didn’t know who I was. I graduated from Berklee College of Music so the pressure to become “someone” was incredibly high. Instead of following a traditional path, I embarked on a journey of self discovery through the jungles of Costa Rica and Mexico. The album reflects on the lessons learned, on how wonderful and beautiful and difficult it can be to truly go deep into the question: Who am I?

#### What would you say is your main source of inspiration?

I am inspired by nature, I often go on extreme hiking trips by myself, I gain wisdom that way. I also love connecting with other artists and musicians, that really gets my creative juices flowing.

#### What are your favorite artist tools? What does your workflow look like?

I compose using Logic Pro X and edit my videos using Final Cut Pro and Red Giant plugins. I feel very comfortable working with computer software, I work very fast and without breaks. When I get into the flow of creating, it feels as if I’m channeling, like I’m just a bridge for some force to spread its message, that’s why I chose Totëm as my name and not my actual name (Katan R Lamarque), my creative process is very mystical.

#### What are some pieces of advice you have for other artists?

I think emotion plays a big part in what we do, sometimes we focus so much on technique that we forget the true purpose of art, which is to connect us with our listeners/viewers/etc and provoke something out of them. Thinking about raw emotions, human instinct, and emotional arcs facilitates the art making process, and sometimes that’s all you need to reach someone on a deep level.
