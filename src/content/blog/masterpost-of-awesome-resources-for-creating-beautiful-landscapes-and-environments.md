Learning to draw beautiful, expressive backgrounds, environments, landscapes is a wonderful skill that will help you become a more well rounded artist. This skill requires you to understand how different components integrate in space. This means sharpening up those **composition, perspective, color theory, and value skills**. 

It's a lot, but it's worth it. 



If you plan to create digitally, before you begin, please consider checking out a  [**Beginner's Guide to Digital Art**](https://artres.xyz/post/beginners-guide-to-digital-art/). The websites at the bottom are particularly useful for all artists!
